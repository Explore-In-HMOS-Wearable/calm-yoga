# Use Cases

- CalmYoga offers a dual-layered approach to mindfulness: Interactive Training and Session Management.

- Interactive Training: Users can explore various yoga poses through high-quality visual guides. This section serves as an educational hub where users learn the correct alignment and benefits of each posture.

- Yoga Sessions: Once users are ready to practice, they can start a guided session. In this mode, the app manages specific durations for each pose, helping users focus on their breathing and form without needing to check their watch constantly.

- Haptic Feedback: To ensure a truly "calm" experience, the app utilizes the @ohos.vibrator kit to provide subtle haptic feedback during pose transitions. These vibrations serve as non-intrusive alerts, allowing users to keep their eyes closed or focus on their posture while knowing exactly when to move to the next step.
